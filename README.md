## <div align="center"> ðŸŒŸðŸŒŽ World Data Database ðŸŒŽðŸŒŸ </div>

### ðŸš€ Overview
This repository contains SQL queries analysing the world database. Prior to our analysis, we added to our previous database 'Adventure Works' with tables representing countries, cities, and populations. The insights include information about cities, countries, their respected populations, and life expectancies.

### âœ… Requirements
A program that can use TSQL for queries. For this project I used Azure Data Studio. You can add the tables to any exisiting database using the ['Creating World DB File'](https://github.com/ElizabethM91/SQL-World-Data-Database/blob/main/Creating%20World%20DB%20file.sql) or can create a new database and then use the file to create the new tables. Once there is a database with the tables established you can use these [queries](https://github.com/ElizabethM91/SQL-World-Data-Database/blob/main/Assignment%20Queries.sql) to follow through my assignment and to do your own analysis.

### ðŸ“Š SQL Analysis
For this project I used Azure Data Studio to hold my database of 'Adventure Works' and the newly created tables to complete my analysis. I used it also to conduct my queries and display my results.
